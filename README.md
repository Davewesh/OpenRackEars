# OpenRackEars
Open Source, ideally easy to use and customize, and free from over priced 12 dollar parts. Based on Script CAD software. 

## What are Open Rack Ears (ORE)?
OREs ideally is an open source project specifically designed to include parametric rack ears for decommisioned enterprise equipement. The point of the project is to provide a functional repository of two types of content. 
* First Rack Ears _known_ to work with a given make/model of equipment. 
* Second parametric Script CAD scripts that can be used in various applications. For example a script for OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, possibly no-GUI options like Python SCAD and so on. 

## Why go through the trouble?
In trying to expand my homelab into a more confined ecosystem I found that rack ears for a given model of fortinet equipment were beyond unreasonably priced. As a result I modeled out the ears in Fusion 360, printed them and felt acomplished that I was able to get a 300 dollar pair of ears for about 20 cents. 

"But 3d Printed rack ears will likely fail" - Most sane people

This is understood and as a result is the reason why I wanted to move forward with this. The idea was to be able to design on the fly ears for any device designed to be rackable. Brocade, Cisco, Fortinet, Aruba, you name it. If you can take a caliper to the hole pattern the parametric script should do the rest. 3D print the part right out of the gate if you want, or export the DXF and upload it to Send-Cut-Send (not affilliated) for some laser cut and bent ears for under a few dollars each.

##Is there really a need for this? 
Unlikely - I didnt look up _any_ other rack ear prices and merely wanted this for myself. After it was mostly finished is when I decided that pushing it here would be somewhat useful to anyone else.
